Question 3
If the data arrives as a stream, the hourly averages must be continuously updated because each new input can impact the calculation.
The solution would look like this:
A dictionary where the key represents the hour, and the value is a list of all the values received for that hour.
Whenever a new value is received, it is added to the corresponding hour in the dictionary, and the hourly average is updated.



Question 4
Parquet format is a compressed and efficient columnar format for storing data, and is therefore good for working with large amounts of data.
Unlike CSV, it allows for fast loading of only specific columns instead of reading all rows and columns, which saves time and resources.
In addition, it maintains a type structure for each column (such as numbers and dates), which streamlines processing processes.
Another advantage is its compatibility with modern tools such as Spark, Hive, AWS Athena, and Pandas, which makes it easy to integrate into advanced data systems.
Parquet offers improved performance and lower memory consumption compared to CSV, especially when managing and analyzing large volumes of data.
